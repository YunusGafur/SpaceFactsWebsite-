        <div class="planet Mercury">
            <span class="planet-name">Mercury</span>
            <p>Size: 1,516 mi</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 36.04 million miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Despite being close to the sun, Mercury can still have ice in permanently shadowed craters due to its extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet Venus">
            <span class="planet-name">Venus</span>
            <p>Size: 7,521 miles</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 67 million miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus, meaning it takes longer to rotate once on its axis than to orbit the sun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet Earth">
            <span class="planet-name">Earth</span>
            <p>Size: 7,917 miles</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 93 million miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Though not perfectly round, Earth is slightly bulging at the equator due to its rotation, making it an oblate spheroid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet Mars">
            <span class="planet-name">Mars</span>
            <p>Size: 4,222 miles</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 142 million miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Often called the "Red Planet" because of the iron oxide dust covering its surface, making it appear rusty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet Jupiter">
            <span class="planet-name">Jupiter</span>
            <p>Size: 88,846 miles</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 484 million miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: As the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter has the shortest day, taking only about 10 hours to complete one rotation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet Saturn">
            <span class="planet-name">Saturn</span>
            <p>Size: 74,698 miles</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 889 million miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Saturn's iconic rings are thought to be relatively young and could be made up of broken-up moons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet Uranus">
            <span class="planet-name">Uranus</span>
            <p>Size: 31,763 miles</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 1.8 billion miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Unlike other planets, Uranus spins almost completely on its side, likely due to a past collision.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet Neptune">
            <span class="planet-name">Neptune</span>
            <p>Size: 30,775 miles</p>
            <p>Distance from the sun: 2.8 billion miles</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Neptune's strong winds are among the fastest in the solar system, reaching speeds of 1,500 mph.</p>
